# OntoCookie

### The cookie ontology for the paper "A Knowledge Graph Based Cookie Consent Visualisation Tool"
by Geni Bushati, Sven Carsten Rasmusen, Anelia Kurteva, Anurag Vats, Petraq Nako, and Anna Fensel

The OntoCooki ontology was built with Protégé and represents the domain of cookies. The main focus
of the ontology is to model cookie types, domain, duration and relevant information extracted from cookie logs,
exported from the Chrome browser with the Cookie Editor application.

Currently OntoCookie version 1 has 20 classes, 13 object properties, 2 data properties and reuses
schema.org and Dublin Core.
